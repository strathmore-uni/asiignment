1. Encapsulation
Student Class
  - Private attributes `name` and `grade`.
  - Public getter and setter methods.
  - Grade validation: If out of the range 0-100, it is set to 0.

2. Method Overloading and Overriding
MathOperations Class
  - Two `multiply()` methods demonstrating method overloading:
    - One method multiplies two integers.
    - Another method multiplies three integers.

Animal Class Hierarchy
  - `Animal` class with `makeSound()` method.
  - `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses override `makeSound()`.
  - Demonstrates polymorphism by calling `makeSound()` on both subclasses.
3. Abstraction
Appliance Abstract Class
  - Abstract method `turnOn()`.
  - `Fan` and `TV` subclasses implement `turnOn()`.
  - Objects created to demonstrate abstraction.
4. Exception Handling
Division Program
  - Accepts two numbers and divides the first by the second.
  - Handles `ArithmeticException` if the second number is zero.
  - Displays error message: "Cannot divide by zero!".
